# CM business messaging API postman collection
This is the postman collection I use at CM to work with our Business Messaging API
[docs.cmtelecom.com](https://docs.cmtelecom.com/en/api/business-messaging-api/)

## Requirements

You'll need a CM account with valid product token. To use WhatsApp and/or Viber, please visit [CM.com](https://www.cm.com/products/text/multi-channel-messaging/)

This Postman Collection and Environment requires the installation of [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).


## Installing

1) Download `collection.json` and `environment.json` onto your local machine
2) Open Postman, click on Import and select the two json files.
3) Once imported, a new API collection will be created, along with the environment.
